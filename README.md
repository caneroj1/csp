Generic constraint satisfaction algorithms in haskell. Going through an AI textbook to learn some basic AI principles. This implements
a backtracking solver for constraint satisfaction problems. It uses Node Consistency and Arc Consistency (AC3) for preprocessing steps,
and employs the Minimum Remaining Values, Degree, and Least Constraining heuristics during the backtracking algorithm.
